            What's two minus one?
            Hope you listen to this song 'cause I, I, I
            'Cause I'm doing right just fine
            I'm doing alright, doing alright
            All the time in the world to myself
            I can go out and drink all day and night
            But why can't I get you off my mind
            I can't get you out of my head, yeah
            Gotta get you out of my head, yeah
            How can you be so fine when I'm, I'm,
