        you can sell yourself
        Any offer is good if you want to be able
        how easy it is
        Open your mouth so much to comment
        And if you think to back down
        You have many traces to erase
        Let me
        that I'm not to blame for seeing you fall
        If I'm not to blame for seeing you fall
        you lose faith
        Any hope is vain and I don't know what to believe
        But forget me
        that no one has called you, you're here again

        You lose faith <br/>
        Any hope is vain and I don't know what to believe <br/>
