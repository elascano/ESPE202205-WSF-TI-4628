        Once upon a younger year
        When all our shadows disappeared
        The animals inside came out to play
        Went face to face with all our fears
        Learned our lessons through the tears
        Made memories we knew would never fade

        One day, my father, he told me
        "Son, don't let it slip away"
        He took me in his arms, I heard him say
        "When you get older
        Your wild heart will live for younger days
        Think of me if ever you're afraid"

        He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
        So live a life you will remember"
        My father told me when I was          just a child
        "These are the nights that never die"
        My father told me
