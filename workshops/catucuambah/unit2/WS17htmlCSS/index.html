			She's got a smile that it seems to me
			           Reminds me of childhood memories
			Where everything was as fresh
			As the bright blue sky

			Now and then when I see her face
			She takes me away to that special place
			And if I stare too long
			I'd probably break down and cry

			Oh, oh, oh, sweet child of mine
			Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine

			She's got eyes of the bluest skies
			As if they thought of rain
			I hate to look into those eyes
			And see an ounce of pain
