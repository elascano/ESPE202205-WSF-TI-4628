		Talk to me softly
	There's something in your eyes
	Don't hang your head in sorrow
	And please don't cry
	I know how you feel inside I've
	I've been there before
	Somethin's changin' inside you
	And don't you know
	
	Don't you cry tonight
	I still love you, baby
	Don't you cry tonight
	Don't you cry tonight
	There's a heaven above you, baby
	And don't you cry tonight
	
	Give me a whisper
	And give me a sigh
	Give me a kiss before you
	Tell me goodbye
	Don't you take it so hard now
	And please don't take it so bad
	I'll still be thinkin' of you
	And the times we had, baby
