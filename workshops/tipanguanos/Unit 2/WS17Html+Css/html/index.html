        The mirror's image, it tells me it's home time                                           
        But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side 
        And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin', carryin' your shoes
        Decided that once again I was just dreamin' of bumpin' into you.

        Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind
        Left you multiple missed calls and to my message, you reply
        "Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
        "Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"

        Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
        I need a partner, well, are you out tonight?
        It's harder and harder to get you to listen
        More I get through the gears
        Incapable of makin' alright decisions, and havin' bad ideas
