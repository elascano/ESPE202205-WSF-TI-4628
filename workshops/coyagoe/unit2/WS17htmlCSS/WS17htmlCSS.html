			My head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghost
			I need to feel something, 'cause I'm still so far from home
			Cross your heart and hope to die
			Promise me you'll never leave my side
			
			Show me what I can't see when the spark in your eyes is gone
			You've got me on my knees I'm your one man cult
			Cross my heart and hope to die
			Promise you I'll never leave your side
						
			'Cause I'm telling you you're all I need
			I promise you you're all I see
			'Cause I'm telling you you're all I need
			I'll never leave
