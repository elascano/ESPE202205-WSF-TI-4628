				<td>Poplar</td>
				<td>Poplars are rapid-growing but relatively short-lived trees. <br>
                    They are widely distributed throughout the northern temperate regions, <br>
                    ranging from North America through Eurasia and northern Africa <br>

				<td>02</td>
				<td>Weeping Willow</td>
				<td>Weeping willow trees are famed for their dramatic, elegant appearance. <br>
                    Their long, graceful branches “weep” into an arch, creating a round canopy <br>
                    that grazes the ground gently. Their narrow leaves are light green on top, <br>
                    with silvery undersides until they turn yellow in autumn
                </td>
				<td>Cold</td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>03</td>
				<td>Oak</td>
				<td>Oak trees are virtually impossible to overlook. Their majestic branches encompass <br>
                    huge areas, although they are just one of this tree's most notable characteristics. <br>
                    The oak tree's giant height is another distinctive feature. Oak trees often reach heights of up to 100 feet, <br>
                    and may extend to a width of up to 150 feet
                </td>
				<td>Cold</td>

			<tr>
				<td>04</td>
				<td>Cypress</td>
				<td>Cypress pines are evergreens with scalelike leaves that are characteristically borne in whorls of three; <br>
                    their tips are often thickened and curve inward. The male cones are small and are produced <br>
                    at the tips of the branches. The female cones are nearly round and feature six woody scales arranged in two whorls. <br>
