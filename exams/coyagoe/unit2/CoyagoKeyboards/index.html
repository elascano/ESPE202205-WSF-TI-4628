			<p>
			  In computer science and computing, the keyboard is a peripheral or input or input device (input) of information. <br/>
			  It consists of a set of keys or buttons arranged horizontally on a sheet, where they act as mechanical levers or <br/>
			  electronic switches, thus allowing the user to enter encrypted information into the computer system.<br/>
			  It operates in a similar way to typewriters: each key is associated with a character, a function or a set of <br/>
			  characters, which, when pressed by the user's fingers, enter a specific signal to the computer, tablet or Smartphone.<br/>
			  The keyboard is probably the main way the user communicates with the computer system. It was also the first to <br/>
			  be devised, at least as far as modern computers are concerned.<br/>
			  Today there are different computer keyboard configurations and different models, depending on their ergonomic <br/>
			  construction and internal logic. Some of them have even incorporated the functions of other peripherals, such as <br/>
			  the mouse: not only do they come in different languages, but they are also adapted to the Operating Systems and <br/>
			  computer models that exist on the market.<br/>
