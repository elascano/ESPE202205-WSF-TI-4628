				<b>Classic keyboards:</b> Those that are rectangular and follow the aesthetics of the standard IBM keyboard.<br/>
				<b>keyboards:</b>  Those that have been designed to adapt to the shape of human hands and not cause as much damage to their joints.<br/>
				<b>Multimedia keyboards:</b> Those that have direct access keys to various functionalities of the computer system, <br/>especially those that have to do with audio, video, connectivity or even certain applications.<br/>
				<b>Flexible keyboards:</b> Those produced from light elastic materials, such as silicone or soft plastic, <br/>and that can therefore bend on themselves, adapt to irregular surfaces or even some can be submerged in water, without affecting their functionality.<br/>
				<b>On-screen keyboards:</b> Those that do not physically exist, but are projected onto a touch screen or touch screen, <br/>and are pressed directly on it.<br/>
				<b>Membrane keyboards:</b> Discontinued due to their low resistance to use, they consisted of two thin plastic sheets or membranes, <br/>equipped with conductive tracks on their inner face, so that when you press with your finger, the electronic signal would pass through.<br/>
