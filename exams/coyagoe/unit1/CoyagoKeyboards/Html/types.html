				Classic keyboards: Those that are rectangular and follow the aesthetics of the standard IBM keyboard.<br/>
				Ergonomic keyboards: Those that have been designed to adapt to the shape of human hands and not cause as much damage to their joints.<br/>
				Multimedia keyboards: Those that have direct access keys to various functionalities of the computer system, especially those that have to do with audio, video, connectivity or even certain applications.<br/>
				Flexible keyboards: Those produced from light elastic materials, such as silicone or soft plastic, and that can therefore bend on themselves, adapt to irregular surfaces or even some can be submerged in water, without affecting their functionality.<br/>
				On-screen keyboards: Those that do not physically exist, but are projected onto a touch screen or touch screen, and are pressed directly on it.<br/>
				Membrane keyboards: Discontinued due to their low resistance to use, they consisted of two thin plastic sheets or membranes, equipped with conductive tracks on their inner face, so that when you press with your finger, the electronic signal would pass through.<br/>
