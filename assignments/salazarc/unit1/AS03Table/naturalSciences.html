            <b>What is an ecosystem?</b> <br>
            The ecosystem is the set of species in a given area that interact with each other and with 
            their abiotic environment; through processes such as predation, parasitism, competition and 
            symbiosis, and with its environment by disintegrating and becoming part of the energy and 
            nutrient cycle. The species of the ecosystem, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals 
            depend on each other. The relationships between species and their environment result in the 
            flow of matter and energy in the ecosystem. <br><br>

            <b>Ecosystem types</b> <br>
            • Aquatic ecosystems. They are characterized by the presence of water as the main component and 
            are the most abundant type of ecosystem: they constitute almost 75% of all known ecosystems. 
            This group includes the ecosystems of the oceans and those of fresh or salty continental waters, 
            such as rivers, lakes and lagoons. <br>
            • Terrestrial ecosystems. They take place on the earth's crust and out of the water in various 
            types of relief: mountains, plains, valleys, deserts. There are significant differences in 
            temperature, oxygen concentration and climate between them, which is why the biodiversity of 
            these ecosystems is large and varied. Some examples of this type of ecosystem are forests, 
            scrublands, steppe and deserts.
