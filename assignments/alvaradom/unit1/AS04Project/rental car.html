        Car rental companies around the world grew so much, including in Ecuador, that in 1995 the European multinational car rental company Sixt took the first step by creating the first car rental WEB.
        The 21st century has arrived, the revolution for the user has begun.
        There was increasingly fierce competition between the classic and large companies, while the new agencies offered cheaper rentals.
        Currently, the car rental industry is still booming and even more so in a globalized world where social networks have become an effective marketing strategy.<br>

        </h1><br>
        It goes back to the beginning of the automotive era, because seeing a car on the streets was at that time more similar to a science fiction event.
        The cradle was Germany, back in 1896, when the first car rental company called Wucherpfennig came to light. It was located in Hamburg where it was the cradle of the automobile.
        That car rental company served clients with very good financial resources.
        Back then it was almost impossible to see a car on any German street or avenue.
        Few had the money to buy a car. It cost an arm and a leg.
        The rental business did so well for this German company that it spread to the American continent and specifically to the United States.
