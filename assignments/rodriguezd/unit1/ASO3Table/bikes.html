<p><h2><center>Road bikes</center></h2>
<center>If your thing is the road, this is the bike you need. It's characterized by downward-curving handlebars and thin wheels, along with lightweight aluminum or carbon fiber frames. In reality, there are very different models, even designed for those who just want to exercise. In any case, within this category are many types of bikes, from competition to endurance.

<p><h2><center>Mountain bikes</center></h2>
    <center>Its design is intended to be used on irregular paths. Mountains, valleys, rocky paths... Are you thinking of going through forests, climbing mountains and enjoying long trails? The versatility and comfort of this type of bike will allow you to ride without fear. To this we must add the resistance of the frames and the straight or double-height handlebars, which facilitates 
    pedaling with a semi-erect torso, control and vision of the road. We can assure you that this is the category of bicycles with the most options, from rigid (without suspension), to those that only have suspension in the front (hardtails) or front and rear (full suspension).

<p><h2><center>BMX bikes</center></h2>
    <center>Do you like fun? Placing your feet on the pedals, scoring a bank pass or hitting an original jump can only be a BMX thing, a cycling discipline performed with 20-inch diameter wheels. Whether racing or freestyle, you need a good bike to practice your stunts.
