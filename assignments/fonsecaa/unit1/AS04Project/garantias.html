        <h2>Garantias</h2>
    </center>

    <h3>1. The money-back guarantee</h3>
    <p>Offering your customers a full refund if they aren’t satisfied with your products is an indication of quality. Or
        rather, your confidence in the quality of your product. Money-back is the most common guarantee and has almost
        become standard practice in retail.
        Nevertheless, while offering it may reduce perceived risks and help you distinguish your products amongst
        competitors, there will always be customers that try to take advantage. For that reason, money-back guarantees
        are usually constrained by a time period, usually 30, 60, or 90 days. Sometimes they can last up to a year or
        even an entire lifetime.
        To determine how long the guarantee should be, you need to examine the specifics of each product. Try to
        establish how long it takes for your customers to use or wear out the product, and add on a little more time.
        The longer your guarantee, the greater the risk of customers cashing it in, but also the more sales it will
        drive.</p>

    <h3>2. The best price guarantee</h3>
    <p>Price is one of the determining factors that influences purchasing decisions. In the world of eCommerce,
        competition is fierce. By implementing the lowest prices for a particular product, you can persuade potential
        customers to make a purchase with you rather than with a competitor.
        The best price guarantee reassures buyers that they are getting the best available offer. If their customers
        manage to find a better deal elsewhere, companies will often match the new price and refund the difference.
        Be careful when implementing this guarantee, as it can significantly hurt margins and even start price wars with
        your competitors. If you take a more reserved approach and don’t offer this guarantee, your customers could
        easily flock to a competitor, leading to lost sales. In any market, promoting your products as the “best price”
        is a high-risk strategy.</p>

    <h3>3. The lifetime guarantee</h3>
    <p>
        Promising your customers a lifetime guarantee on your products is a bold statement of confidence. Lifetime
        guarantees are usually reserved for higher-priced products that make people question whether it’s worth
        investing the money. However, splurging on a costly backpack or a good set of knives isn’t as daunting when you
        know they will last forever.
        It shows that you believe your products can last a lifetime, which almost always justifies their price. Offering
        money back is not the only option, either: you could offer repairs, refills, or replacements depending on your
        product.
        Bear in mind that a lifetime guarantee isn’t something to be taken lightly, and should be used only if you have
        absolute confidence that your products really are that durable.
