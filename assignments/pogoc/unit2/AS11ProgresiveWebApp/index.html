        <p>
            The concept of anime, however, appears more frequently related to a Japanese word that alludes to animation. The notion, in this framework, is used to name cartoons of Japanese origin.

            Anime is a cultural and entertainment phenomenon that enjoys great popularity internationally. It is an art that is linked to manga (Japanese comics), cosplay (the use of costumes) and other disciplines and trends.

        <p>
            Emakimono and kagee are considered precursors to Japanese animation. Emakimono was common in the 11th century. Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes as the emakimono unrolled from right to left in chronological order, like a moving panorama. Kagee was popular during the Edo period and originated from China's shadow play. Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the 18th century. The paper play called Kamishibai emerged in the 12th century and remained popular in street theater until the 1930s. Bunraku theater puppets and ukiyo-e prints are considered ancestors of characters in most Japanese animations. Finally, the manga was a great inspiration for Japanese animation. Cartoonists Kitzawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used cinematic elements in their strips.

            In the 1960s, animator and manga artist Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified Disney's animation techniques to cut costs and limit the number of frames in his productions. Originally intended as temporary measures to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with an inexperienced staff, many of its limited animation practices came to define the style of the medium. Three Tales (1960) was the first anime film to be broadcast on television; the first anime television series was Instant History (1961–64). An early and influential success was Astro Boy (1963–66), a television series directed by Tezuka based on his manga of the same name. Many animators from Tezuka's Mushi Production later established major anime studios (including Madhouse, Sunrise, and Pierrot).
