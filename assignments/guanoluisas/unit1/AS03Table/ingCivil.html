		<p>Civil engineering is the discipline in charge of carrying out all kinds of 
		infrastructures that society needs for its development, always trying to carry 
		them out in the most economical and sustainable way possible. To do this, they 
		must be able to understand a multitude of factors (technical, economic and 
		social) that affect infrastructures in one way or another and act accordingly.</p>
		 
		<p>
		<b>What a Civil Engineer do?</b><br>
		Roads and highways, bridges and footbridges, dams and reservoirs, drinking water
		supply networks and sanitation networks (sewerage), ports, urban developments and
		many other infrastructures are the responsibility of the civil engineer. But not
		everything is building. Economic aspects and aspects of management and exploitation
		of these infrastructures are also part of the main axis of many tasks carried out 
		by civil engineers around the world.

		<b>What specialties exist?</b><br>
		Civil engineering is very broad and it would be impossible to cover it in its entirety. 
		In the Degree in Civil and Territorial Engineering that I study, and once you have 
		passed the first three years, you can choose one of these specialties:<br><br>
		• Civil Constructions: you will specialize in the calculation of structures, construction
		projects, buildings, bridges, tunnels, foundations, etc. It is, without a doubt, the most
		complicated specialty.<br>
		• Transport and Urban Services: you will specialize in the design of roads, railways, traffic
		management, port operations, etc.<br>
		• Hydrology: it will specialize in the design and construction of dams, other hydraulic 
		infrastructures (canals), energy and power plants, etc.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>What skills should a civil engineer have?</b><br>
		I want to take away from you the idea that by studying civil engineering you are going to eat
		the world like that just because. You will have the bricks, but you will have to work very 
		hard to build the house. The competition is brutal. Other aspects such as mastery of a second
		language (especially English), communication skills (public speaking), leadership and critical
		thinking are essential. The domain of agile methodologies and BIM are also increasingly important.
