Report
For this occasion we went to our user Fabricio Reyes, who recorded his expressions 
to examine the complexity contained in the interface. It can be seen at the beginning 
that the page generates surprise and curiosity at the same time, however, during the 
course of the page, when entering data he had difficulty due to the language and could 
not understand some terms.

From our point of view we can conclude through the expressions of the user had a 
positive impact when initially seeing the interface, then when browsing their 
expressions changed and interest in the products offered can be noticed, when a 
customer wants to purchase a product and is find a suitable price, it will have a 
similar behavior to the user.

In the same way, as a suggestion, he indicated that the data validation should be 
carried out, for which a small annoyance is observed. Likewise, he had no problems 
navigating since the information is organized.
