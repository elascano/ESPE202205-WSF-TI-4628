        The series takes place at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom (Bikini Bottom, in English), where a square yellow sea sponge, called SpongeBob, lives. Bob's house is a pineapple, where he lives with his pet snail Gary. SpongeBob loves his job as a cook at the Krusty Krab restaurant and has the ability to get into all sorts of trouble without meaning to.

        When he's not getting on the nerves of Squidward, his octopus neighbor, Bob gets into a lot of trouble and weird experiences with his two best friends: the cute but a bit plain Patrick, a pink starfish and obese; and Sandy, a smart, strong but a bit cocky squirrel who lives on the seabed in his house, an underwater polyurethane dome. Sandy comes out of the dome wearing an astronaut suit so she can breathe underwater.
