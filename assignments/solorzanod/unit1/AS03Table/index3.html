		HTML is the language used to define the content of web pages. Basically, 
		it is a set of tags used to define the text and other elements that make up a web page, such as images, 
		lists, videos, etc.
		</p>
		<br /><p>
		HTML is a mark-up language for the creation of hypertext documents, very easy to learn, which allows anyone, 
		even if they have never programmed in their life, to take on the task of creating a website. 
		HTML is easy and we will soon be able to master the language. Later on, 
		professional results will be achieved thanks to our design skills and our artistic vein, 
		as well as the incorporation of other languages to define the format in which the webs have to be presented, such as CSS.
