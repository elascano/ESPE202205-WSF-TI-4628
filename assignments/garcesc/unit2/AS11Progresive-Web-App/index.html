                        The melting of the poles is accelerating. There is evidence that the temperature of the oceans has increased, which could be the original trigger for the thinning of the ice cap. The Earth's surface temperature is also changing and affecting warming. The year 2014 was the warmest on record since 1880. How does this affect the planet's poles? The situation of melting of the glaciers that Antarctica is suffering has been classified as irreversible.

It is in this area of the planet, together with Greenland, where sea level rise occurs the most.

On the other hand, the ice cover of the lakes was reduced by 22% in twenty years, between 1991 and 2011, as a result of climate change, according to the European Space Agency (ESA).

It is indisputable that the effects of climate change are having repercussions in these fragile areas of the planet, where a variation in temperatures has tragic consequences.
